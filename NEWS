reports 0.1.2
----------------------------------------------------------------
This is a bug fix release

BUG FIXES

* `GQ` did not handle block quotes correctly in what printed to the console.  
  This behavior has been corrected.

* `GQ`, `CA`, `LL` and `US` now parse out ligature "fi" as "fi" rather than "?".  
  Warnings were added for cases when liigatures are detected.

* Fixed the Description file for the basic_web template (missing info).

* `reveal.js` resulted in an error if a reference page was not supplied.   This 
  behavior has been corrected.

CHANGES

* `install_pandoc` is no longer exported as this functionality can be found in 
  the installr package


reports 0.1.1
----------------------------------------------------------------

* Package designed to provide efficient work flow in writing and presenting 
  academic articles and other reports
