Some notes on the first slide

---

## Heads Up

reveal.js is a framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML. You'll need a browser with support for CSS 3D transforms to see it in its full glory.

## Point of View

Press ESC to enter the slide overview. Hold down alt and click on any element to zoom in on it using [zoom.js](http://lab.hakim.se/zoom-js). Alt + click anywhere to zoom back out.

---

## RVL.IO

If you don't like writing slides in HTML you can use the online editor [rvl.io](http://rvl.io).

---

## Works in Mobile Safari

Try it out! You can swipe through the slides and pinch your way to the overview.

## Marvolous Unordered List

- No order here
- Or here
- Or here
- Or here

## Fantastic Ordered List

1. One is smaller than...
2. Two is smaller than...
3. Three!

--- #transitions

## TRANSITION STYLES
You can select from different transitions, like: 

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis', comment = NA}
transitions = c("cube", "page", "concave", "zoom", "linear", "fade", "none", "default")
names(transitions) = gsub("^([a-z])", "\\U\\1", transitions, perl = TRUE)
x = sprintf("[%s](?transition=%s#/transitions)", names(transitions), transitions)
cat(paste(x, collapse = ' - '))
```

--- #themes

## Themes

Reveal.js comes with a few themes built in: 

```{r echo = F, results = 'asis', comment = NA}
themes = c("sky", "beige", "simple", "serif", "night", "default", "solarized", "moon")
names(themes) = gsub("^([a-z])", "\\U\\1", themes, perl = TRUE)
x = sprintf("[%s](?theme=%s#/themes)", names(themes), themes)
cat(paste(x, collapse = ' - '))
```

<small>* Theme demos are loaded after the presentation which leads to flicker. In production you should load your theme in the `<head>` using a `<link>`.</small>

--- ds:alert &vertical

## Global State
Set `data-state="something"` on a slide and "something" will be added as a class to the document element when the slide is open. This lets you apply broader style changes, like switching the background.

<a href="#" class="image navigate-down">
  <img width="178" height="238" 
    src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png" alt="Down arrow">
</a>

*** ds:blackout

## Blackout

<a href="#" class="image navigate-down">
  <img width="178" height="238" 
    src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png" alt="Down arrow">
</a>

<a href="#" class="image navigate-next">
  <img width="178" height="238" alt="Up arrow" style="-webkit-transform: rotate(-90deg);"
    src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/arrow.png" >
</a>

## Custom Events

Additionally custom events can be triggered on a per slide basis by binding to the data-state name.

```
Reveal.addEventListener( 'customevent', function() {
  console.log( '"customevent" has fired' );
} );
```

## Clever Quotes

These guys come in two forms, inline:  <q>The nice thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from and block:</q>

> For years there has been a theory that millions of monkeys typing at random on millions of typewriters would reproduce the entire works of Shakespeare. The Internet has proven this theory to be untrue.

---

## Pretty Code

```
function linkify( selector ) {
  if( supports3DTransforms ) {

    var nodes = document.querySelectorAll( selector );

    for( var i = 0, len = nodes.length; i < len; i++ ) {
      var node = nodes[i];

      if( !node.className ) ) {
        node.className += ' roll';
      }
    };
  }
}
```

## Intergalactic Interconnections

You can link between slides internally, [like this](#/2/3).

---

## Fragmented Views

Hit the next arrow...

.fragment ... to step through ...

> - any type
> - of view
> - __fragments__

---

## Take a Moment

Press b or period on your keyboard to enter the 'paused' mode. This mode is helpful when you want to take distracting slides off the screen during a presentation.


---

## Incremental Paragraphs

.fragment This is paragraph 1 and should appear on first click.

.fragment This is paragraph 2 and should appear on second click.

.small [Back to the Beginning](#/0)


---

## Title

This is a slide

- point 1
- point 2
- point 3

---

## Incremental Reveal

These points should be animated

> - Point 1
> - .highlight-red Point 2
> - .grow Point 3

<script>
$('ul.incremental li').addClass('fragment')
</script>


---

## Code with slide

```{r eval = T}
library(ggplot2)
qplot(wt, mpg, data = mtcars)
```
